1) iOS
2) React Native (JS)
3) Yes I'd like to explore cross-platform dev
4) I have an app idea planned out with a friend who would like to market in on iOS. Developing in this environment will help me better understand the quarks of iOS development work but I plan to use React Native because I'd really like to expand behond just iphone without maintaing a seperate Android app.
